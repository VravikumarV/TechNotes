1. A zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. Rotation of the array means that each element is shifted right by one index, and the last element of the array is also moved to the first place.
For example, the rotation of array A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] is [6, 3, 8, 9, 7]. The goal is to rotate array A K times; that is, each element of A will be shifted to the right by K indexes

2.A dominant member in the array is one that occupies over half the positions in the array, for example: {3, 67, 23, 67, 67} 67 is a
dominant member because it appears in the array in 3/5 (>50%) positions. With O(n) time and O(1) space.
