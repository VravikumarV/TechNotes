Apache Storm:
**************
        
        Storm is a fault tolerant, distributed framework for real-time computation and processing data streams. It takes the data from various
        data sources such as HBase, Kafka, Cassandra and many other applications and processes the data in real time. It has been written in Clojure 
        and Java.
        
        Storm topology is the combination of Spout and Bolt. It is same as Map and Reduce in Hadoop.

        Stream: Stream can be considered as Data Pipeline it is the actual data that we received from a data source.

        Spout: Spout receive data from different-different data sources such as APIs. It continuously receives data from data sources and sends it to Bolt for processing.

        Bolt: It is logical processing units takes data from Spout and perform logical operations such as aggregation, filtering, joining & interacting with data sources and databases.
        



        
        
Apache Kafka:
***************

      Kafka use to handle big amount of data in the fraction of seconds. It is a distributed message broker which relies on topics and partitions.
      
      It provides real-time data streaming. It takes the data from different websites such as Facebook, Twitter and APIs and passes the data to any different processing application (Apache Storm) in Hadoop environment.
